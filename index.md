I am currently a junior student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/)(SJTU), majored in Statistics. I'm currently supervised by Professor [Di Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/statdiwang/) at SJTU.

My research interests involve robust statistics and theory of machine learning and deep learning, and I warmly welcome any invitations for further discussions!
